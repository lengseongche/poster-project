## Exploring the Joint Effects of Education and Marriage on Income Inequality

### Introduction
Education is an important factor affecting an individual’s capacity for social mobility and income later in life. Current literature on the relationship between education and income differences in China has examined it from several different angles, including regional differences, family investments, gender, and English language proficiency (1,2). However, no research has examined how marital status and gender affect the education-income relationship. Marital status could affect the kinds of social networks individuals have access to, the types of jobs that may be available to them, affected by other social responsibilities they may have. Gender is another important factor, as marital status and education will certainly affect men and women differently. 

We aim to investigate the relationship between income and education in China and see how marital status affects this relationship. We utilize the survey data from the 2016 wave of the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) to investigate mainly the interactive effect of education and marital status on income. The CFPS data can be downloaded via the link below.

### Methods

Education is operationalized as the highest educational attainment in two levels, with and without a college degree. Marital status consists of two levels, unmarried and married. Income is coded in Chinese Yuan (CNY) and is transformed to logarithm form for this analysis. Following Cairo’s instructions for finding relations between variables through visualization (Cairo, 2016), we address whether associations exist among the three variables and then look for correlations (linear relationships). After that, we will further investigate how the potential associations and correlations among education, marital status, and income vary by gender. Additionally, we control for demographic variables, including urban status, age, employment sector, and household registration type.

We use both quantitative (OLS regression analysis) and qualitative (visualizations) approaches to investigate the education and marriage effects on incomes. 

### Conclusion 

Please refer to poster.Rmd for code and results. The visualizations were also added to the repo. 

Some key takeaways:
1) The individuals with consistently highest incomes tend to be college educated, married individuals. Unmarried, college-educated individuals see more variation in incomes. 
2) Both marital status and education independently increase income amounts. 
3) Our results suggest that the combination of higher education and marriage predicts higher income in China. This could be because marriage gives an individual access to more social networks and connections, allowing them access to higher paying jobs. Another explanation could be that people with higher socioeconomic status have more access to marriage due to social networks, financial stability, etc. 
4) A beneficial next step in this research would be qualitative research on how individuals have been able to achieve higher incomes, in order to investigate the pathways through which these relationships are shaped.
